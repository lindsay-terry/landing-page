# Landing Page

## Description

This project provides a landing page to gather customer information for a budding business with more to come.  It includes a fixed header with a navigation bar on the top, an image and a caption that gathers excitement for new additions, and a section where customers can enter their names and email addresses.

## Usage

This page was built to be a landing page.  The three links at the top can be utilized to access GitHub, my personal GitHub repository page, and the contact link sends the user down to the "Contact" section at the bottom of the page.  Because this page was mainly built as practice using CSS and HTML, no data can actually be collected, but a user can submit a name and email address and push the working "Send" button to submit their information.  I learned a lot working on this page, especially regarding how margin and padding works and can impact, intentionally or unintentionally, other elements on the page.
